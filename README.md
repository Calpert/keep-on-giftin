## Description:
An application that reminds the user of certain dates to send friends and family gifts/cards.

The user will create profiles for each family member or friend. Profile includes:
* Date of Birth
* Relationship to user
* Annual holidays the person celebrates
* Custom holidays for one-time events (graduations, weddings, etc.) that they are celebrating
* Home address to send gifts/cards to

Then the app will produce a calendar with reminders of specific dates a few days before to remind to send a gift.
Once the annual event has passed, date will reset to next year. One-time events will disappear.
