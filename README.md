## Description:
An application that reminds the user of certain dates to send friends and family gifts/cards.

The user will create profiles for each family member or friend. Profile includes:
-Date of Birth
-Relationship to user
-Annual holidays the person celebrates
-Custom holidays for one-time events (graduations, weddings, etc.) that they are celebrating
-Home address to send gifts/cards to

Then the app will produce a calendar with reminders of specific dates a few days before to remind to send a gift.
Once the annual event has passed, date will reset to next year. One-time events will disappear.
